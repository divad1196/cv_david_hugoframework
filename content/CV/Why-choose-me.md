There are many candidates out there, each with technical skills and experience. So why choose me over them? 

## Multi-Field Expertise

I have solid experience across development, system administration, and cybersecurity, which allows me to see the bigger picture and make informed decisions.  
My knowledge in each domain is strong on its own — especially in development — but combined, these skills reinforce each other and give me a unique perspective.

## Leadership and Project Management

I combine deep technical knowledge with the ability to lead and deliver complex projects in a simple way.  

Project management is often criticized because either engineers who haven’t learned how to manage projects take the role, or managers without technical experience struggle to connect with the team.

My strong sense of empathy helps me bridge that gap, connecting management, engineers, and users or customers effectively.

## Deliver Results

I focus on the big picture and consistently deliver results that exceed expectations.  
This applies not only to my own tasks, but also to the projects I lead — even outside IT contexts.

# Summary

Despite my relatively young age, I’m a Swiss-army knife capable of tackling complex problems and bringing large projects to life. 
I can develop advanced algorithms, troubleshoot intricate infrastructure issues, identify security risks, and lead teams to success.
