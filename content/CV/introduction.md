# Who am I ?

I am a curious and eager learner that always had a big interest on science and logic.  
Despite that, I discovered Computer Science late at the age of 21 while I was studying Physics at the EPFL. I changed my field and this was the best decision I ever made.  

I made a Cybersecurity Engineering degree.  
While I currently never had a job solely focus on this field, Cybersecurity has always been part of my work.

Through my career, I have had multiple roles:
- Lead Developer (embracing DevSecOps mentality!)
- Lead Sysadmin
- Cloud Engineer
- Project Manager
- ERP Expert

I was able to reach these positions by learning, practicing and mastering the required skills for each of them.
