# Who am I ?

I am a curious and eager learner with a deep interest in science and logic.
Although I discovered Computer Science relatively late, at the age of 21 while studying Physics at EPFL, I quickly realized it was the right path for me â€” and switching fields was the best decision I ever made.

I hold a degree in Cybersecurity Engineering. Cybersecurity has always been an integral part of my work.

Throughout my career, I have taken on multiple roles:

- Lead Developer (with a strong DevSecOps mindset)
- Lead Sysadmin
- Cloud Engineer
- Project Manager
- ERP Expert

I reached these positions by continuously learning, practicing, and mastering the skills required for each of them.
