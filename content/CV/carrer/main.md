  * Consolidation of inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, 
* Challenges:
  * Work with heterogeneous hardward and software version
  * Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.
  * Smooth transition from legacy to newer architecture/design
  * Avoid creating technical debts; favorize simple automations with great value

I joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.
My management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.
