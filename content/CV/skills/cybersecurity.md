My CS Bachelor degree is about security. The skills I got and trained are:
* Security risks awareness: What is dangerous and why
* Security mitigation: How to prevent/fix such risks
* Software/Malware/Cryptographic Analysis. Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools...
* Attacks
  * On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers)
  * On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, ...). Tools: wireshark, scapy, nmap, ...
  * High/Low level programming attacks (e.g. various kind of injections like SQL injection or XSS/CSRF, buffer overflows, weak OAuth flows, ...)
  * Side channel and fault attacks
  * Various attacks using Metasploit and python scripting
* Defenses
  * High/Low level programming (Good practices and algorithms, input sanitization, ...)
  * Network: firewall, WAF, Snort
  * Cryptography: Symetric and Asymetric Signatures(Simple, multi-sig and threshold)/Encryption(operating modes, authenticated cipher)/hash(cryptographically safe vs unsafe), SSL/TLS, ...

A complete audit of a company was also part of the formation.  
It is worth mentioning that, even though the knowledge required are linked, we did more attacks than defenses.  
Nb: We did learn a lot, but these skills need to be sharpened with the experience.
