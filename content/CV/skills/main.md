## Lead Software Engineer

Rather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.
This pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.

I also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.

## System Administrator (Linux)

Beyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.
By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.

Being initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.

## Cybersecurity Engineer

I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.

I also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.

This naturally led me from DevOps to **DevSecOps**, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.

## Project Manager

Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.

Having experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.

In addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.
