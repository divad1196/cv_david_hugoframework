## A Curious and Eager Learner

I am a curious and eager learner with a strong interest in exploring and mastering a wide range of topics, particularly those related to science, logic, and technology.  
In fact, I’m interested in most subjects — it’s really just a matter of time and resources.  
For example, I’m interested in woodworking, electronics, and similar hobbies, but they can be expensive and take a lot of time to learn properly.

I love brain teasers like puzzles or Sudoku. From time to time, I buy myself a new puzzle. I have now collected a nice little collection.
I also enjoy learning languages. Recently, I started studying Japanese because I wanted to explore a language that is very different from what I already know, with its unique alphabet and structure.

### a few examples

I have my "phases": I dive deeply into a topic for months or even years up to a point that I find satisfying.  
I care about doing things "the right way", but I am also very pragmatic.

Over the years, I had different hobbies:
- Playing guitar
- Drawing and digital drawing
- Cooking, including techniques like making sushi and maintaining sharp knives  
- Coffee & Tea extraction and degustation
- 3D modeling
- Learning about economy, marketing, and management  
- Home gardening
- Workplace ergonomics, especially ergonomic mice, keyboards and chairs
- ...

These hobbies are still part of my life, and I continue to practice and improve them, even if I now dedicate less time to each.

## Interest in others

I also like to talk and share with others, but I don't mean small talk. I prefer more thoughtful discussions and debates.  
I consider myself a good listener, always trying to see all sides of a situation.

Sociology fascinates me, I even dedicated my gymnasium maturity project to this topic.  
I’ve always been attentive to what people want, don’t want, say, or leave unsaid.  
While I might not make a huge display of sympathy, I am someone with a great empathy.

## How I Landed in Computer Science

Computer Science clicked for me relatively late. I was 21, studying Physics at the EPFL, when I discovered Linux and C++. It was a revelation.  
I began spending most of my free time learning programming and finally decided to change my career.  
This was the best decision I ever made.

I taught myself through online courses and personal projects and then landed a programming internship where I quickly made a strong impression.
I gained responsibilities and got offered the opportunity to continue working at the company while completing my studies part-time over four years instead of three.


Computer Science in general, not just programming, has become for me a passion.
