## Software Engineer
I discovered programming at the EPFL around 2016 and started learning it by myself on my free time.
During this time, I mostly focused on C/C++ and algorithms, but I took a quick look at java, javascript and bash scripting too.
I then found a one year stage in 2018 needing Python, Postgresql Web technologies in order to enter the engineering school.


The following chart shows my own skills evaluation against what I think there is left for me to learn.
