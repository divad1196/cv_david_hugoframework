Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer\nI have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager\nProject management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a black box, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything. Listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP, where I was also the expert in logistics and manufacturing. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a black box, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything. Listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP, where I was also the expert in logistics and manufacturing. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a black box, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP, where I was also the expert in logistics and manufacturing. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a black box, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP, where I was also the expert in logistics and manufacturing. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a black box, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

This pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\nI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach and make sure that they feel valued and respected.\nMore information about the programming languages I use\nSystem Administrator (Linux) Beyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues. By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach and make sure that they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Nagra — Kudelski Group: DevOps Engineer Cheseaux-sur-Lausanne, 1033 (VD) 2023 - Today Skills: Extensive use of DevOps Tools: Terraform, Docker, Ansible, python/bash scripts, Gitlab / Azure DevOps pipelines Multi-cloud / SaaS solutions: AWS, Cloudflare and a bit of Azure (App registration / enterprise application, Azure Deveops) Take over of abandoned projects / inventories Data retrieval and analysis PaloAlto Firewalls / Cisco routers and switches Developement and consolidation of the inventories: Netbox, ServiceNow, Denodo Challenges: Work with heterogeneous hardware and software version Extra care to transfer the knowledge, especially to non-devops people.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

This pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\nI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\nMore information about the programming languages I use\nSystem Administrator (Linux) Beyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues. By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs.

Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements. ServiceNow We used ServiceNow to expose our services in the Catalog.\nThis way, the rest of the company could easily ask us for standardized tasks.\nMy contributions Create and fix existing Catalog Items Added external automations that would pull from ServiceNow and/or push data to it.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements. ServiceNow We used ServiceNow to expose our services in the Catalog.\nThis way, the rest of the company could easily ask us for standardized tasks.\nMy contributions Create and fix existing Catalog Items Added external automations that would pull from ServiceNow and/or push data to it. Developed Flow Tools for ServiceNow, like Actions I integrated ServiceNow with Power Automate Platform Of course, I was also a user and fullfiler of the platform.\nPKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI EJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI:\nThere was no documentation We had no track of who asked for what, when and why. The configuration were wrong, for example: nobody was receiving any notification some operations were wrongly blocked by the WAF (because the mail template were using ${variable} in templates, which looked like shell-injections) we needed to manually extract the OID value and search on the ActiveDirectory to find the requester\u0026rsquo;s email All the processes were done manually I fixed all the configuration issues and documented all processes.\nI added features like ACME to allow automatic management of the certificates.\nThis way:\nIt was easier for user to ask for certificates Validation was delegated to the internal DNS Renewal was automatically managed All the internal traffic became encrypted and trusted ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/kudelski/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"nagra--kudelski-group-devops-engineer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nagra.com/\"\u003eNagra — Kudelski Group\u003c/a\u003e: DevOps Engineer\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-of-projects\"\u003eExample of Projects\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ai-integration\"\u003eAI integration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the advent of AI, the company pushed to integrate AI as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\nI was requested to evaluate the complexity and benefits of implementing it.\nI worked mainly with CrewAI, Ollama and Python on LLMs.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Nagra — Kudelski Group"},{"content":"My CS Bachelor degree is about security.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I made sure that all domains had an owner and that, upon departure of the owner, a notification would be sent before departure to ensure proper transfer of the ownership.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo Denodo is an aggregation plateform that allowed us to take data from different sources, transform and combine them to finally expose them to different users. We could for example combine data from our IPAM inventory and results of internal scans.\nMy contributions Create, fix and simplified different views.\nUsing less obvious tools like xpath, I simplified most of our views. I developed a custom extension to add many tools include some necessary for INET operations.\nI also tested the performances impact to optimize our joins. Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements. ServiceNow We used ServiceNow to expose our services in the Catalog.\nThis way, the rest of the company could easily ask us for standardized tasks.\nMy contributions Create and fix existing Catalog Items Added external automations that would pull from ServiceNow and/or push data to it. Developed Flow Tools for ServiceNow, like Actions I integrated ServiceNow with Power Automate Platform Of course, I was also a user and fullfiler of the platform.\nPKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI EJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI:\nThere was no documentation We had no track of who asked for what, when and why. The configuration were wrong, for example: nobody was receiving any notification some operations were wrongly blocked by the WAF (because the mail template were using ${variable} in templates, which looked like shell-injections) we needed to manually extract the OID value and search on the ActiveDirectory to find the requester\u0026rsquo;s email All the processes were done manually I fixed all the configuration issues and documented all processes.\nI added features like ACME to allow automatic management of the certificates.\nThis way:\nIt was easier for user to ask for certificates Validation was delegated to the internal DNS Renewal was automatically managed All the internal traffic became encrypted and trusted ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/kudelski/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"nagra--kudelski-group-devops-engineer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nagra.com/\"\u003eNagra — Kudelski Group\u003c/a\u003e: DevOps Engineer\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-of-projects\"\u003eExample of Projects\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ai-integration\"\u003eAI integration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the advent of AI, the company pushed to integrate AI as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\nI was requested to evaluate the complexity and benefits of implementing it.\nI worked mainly with CrewAI, Ollama and Python on LLMs.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Nagra — Kudelski Group"},{"content":"My CS Bachelor degree is about security.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs.

I worked mainly with CrewAI, Ollama and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use-cases like corporate-specific responses would be solved by existing products.\nUnless we were willing to create a brand new product, implementing AI ourselves would have been a technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory As many company, we own hundreds of domain names, but we had no proper track of it.\nThere was a previous attempt of inventory on ServiceNow, but it was not up-to-date and badly designed.\nI made an assesment of the situation and started a Corporate-wide collect of information over a few months to consolidate the inventory. I made sure that all domains had an owner and that, upon departure of the owner, a notification would be sent before departure to ensure proper transfer of the ownership.\nThis inventory has many benefits:\nWe can create security scans and monitoring based on this inventory In case of issue, the person of contact is known which make the resolution faster Monitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo Denodo is an aggregation plateform that allowed us to take data from different sources, transform and combine them to finally expose them to different users. We could for example combine data from our IPAM inventory and results of internal scans.\nMy contributions Create, fix and simplified different views.\nUsing less obvious tools like xpath, I simplified most of our views. I developed a custom extension to add many tools include some necessary for INET operations.\nI also tested the performances impact to optimize our joins. Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements. ServiceNow We used ServiceNow to expose our services in the Catalog.\nThis way, the rest of the company could easily ask us for standardized tasks.\nMy contributions Create and fix existing Catalog Items Added external automations that would pull from ServiceNow and/or push data to it. Developed Flow Tools for ServiceNow, like Actions I integrated ServiceNow with Power Automate Platform Of course, I was also a user and fullfiler of the platform.\nPKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI EJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI:\nThere was no documentation We had no track of who asked for what, when and why.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I worked mainly with CrewAI, Ollama and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use-cases like corporate-specific responses would be solved by existing products.\nUnless we were willing to create a brand new product, implementing AI ourselves would have been a technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory As many company, we own hundreds of domain names, but we had no proper track of it.\nThere was a previous attempt of inventory on ServiceNow, but it was not up-to-date and badly designed. The domains were also scattered on multiple registrar platform.\nI made an assesment of the situation and started a Corporate-wide collect of information over a few months to consolidate the inventory. I made sure that all domains had an owner and that, upon departure of the owner, a notification would be sent before departure to ensure proper transfer of the ownership.\nThis inventory has many benefits:\nWe can create security scans and monitoring based on this inventory In case of issue, the person of contact is known which makes the resolution faster We can periodically review the domains and get rid of the unused one. This can serve as the source-of-truth for automations. Monitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo Denodo is an aggregation plateform that allowed us to take data from different sources, transform and combine them to finally expose them to different users. We could for example combine data from our IPAM inventory and results of internal scans.\nMy contributions Create, fix and simplified different views.\nUsing less obvious tools like xpath, I simplified most of our views. I developed a custom extension to add many tools include some necessary for INET operations.\nI also tested the performances impact to optimize our joins. Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements. ServiceNow We used ServiceNow to expose our services in the Catalog.\nThis way, the rest of the company could easily ask us for standardized tasks.\nMy contributions Create and fix existing Catalog Items Added external automations that would pull from ServiceNow and/or push data to it. Developed Flow Tools for ServiceNow, like Actions I integrated ServiceNow with Power Automate Platform Of course, I was also a user and fullfiler of the platform.\nPKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI EJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI:\nThere was no documentation We had no track of who asked for what, when and why. The configuration were wrong, for example: nobody was receiving any notification some operations were wrongly blocked by the WAF (because the mail template were using ${variable} in templates, which looked like shell-injections) we needed to manually extract the OID value and search on the ActiveDirectory to find the requester\u0026rsquo;s email All the processes were done manually I fixed all the configuration issues and documented all processes.\nI added features like ACME to allow automatic management of the certificates.\nThis way:\nIt was easier for user to ask for certificates Validation was delegated to the internal DNS Renewal was automatically managed All the internal traffic became encrypted and trusted ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/kudelski/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"nagra--kudelski-group-devops-engineer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nagra.com/\"\u003eNagra — Kudelski Group\u003c/a\u003e: DevOps Engineer\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-of-projects\"\u003eExample of Projects\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ai-integration\"\u003eAI integration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the advent of AI, the company pushed to integrate AI as much as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\nI was requested to evaluate the complexity and benefits of implementing it.\nI worked mainly with CrewAI, Ollama and Python on LLMs.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Nagra — Kudelski Group"},{"content":"My CS Bachelor degree is about security.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I worked mainly with CrewAI, Ollama and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use-cases like corporate-specific responses would be solved by existing products.\nUnless we were willing to create a brand new product, implementing AI ourselves would have been a technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts.

We could for example combine data from our IPAM inventory and results of internal scans.\nMy contributions Create, fix and simplified different views.\nUsing less obvious tools like xpath, I simplified most of our views. I developed a custom extension to add many tools include some necessary for INET operations.\nI also tested the performances impact to optimize our joins. Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo Denodo is an aggregation plateform that allowed us to take data from different sources, transform and combine them to finally expose them to different users. We could for example combine data from our IPAM inventory and results of internal scans.\nMy contributions Create, fix and simplified different views.\nUsing less obvious tools like xpath, I simplified most of our views. I developed a custom extension to add many tools include some necessary for INET operations.\nI also tested the performances impact to optimize our joins. Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements. ServiceNow We used ServiceNow to expose our services in the Catalog.\nThis way, the rest of the company could easily ask us for standardized tasks.\nMy contributions Create and fix existing Catalog Items Added external automations that would pull from ServiceNow and/or push data to it.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI EJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI:\nThere was no documentation We had no track of who asked for what, when and why. The configuration were wrong, for example: nobody was receiving any notification some operations were wrongly blocked by the WAF (because the mail template were using ${variable} in templates, which looked like shell-injections) we needed to manually extract the OID value and search on the ActiveDirectory to find the requester\u0026rsquo;s email All the processes were done manually I fixed all the configuration issues and documented all processes.\nI added features like ACME to allow automatic management of the certificates.\nThis way:\nIt was easier for user to ask for certificates Validation was delegated to the internal DNS Renewal was automatically managed All the internal traffic became encrypted and trusted ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/kudelski/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"nagra--kudelski-group-devops-engineer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nagra.com/\"\u003eNagra — Kudelski Group\u003c/a\u003e: DevOps Engineer\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-of-projects\"\u003eExample of Projects\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ai-integration\"\u003eAI integration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise of AI, I was tasked with evaluating the complexity and benefits of its implementation.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI EJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI:\nThere was no documentation We had no track of who asked for what, when and why. The configuration were wrong, for example: nobody was receiving any notification some operations were wrongly blocked by the WAF (because the mail template were using ${variable} in templates, which looked like shell-injections) we needed to manually extract the OID value and search on the ActiveDirectory to find the requester\u0026rsquo;s email All the processes were done manually I fixed all the configuration issues and documented all processes.\nI added features like ACME to allow automatic management of the certificates.\nThis way:\nIt was easier for user to ask for certificates Validation was delegated to the internal DNS Renewal was automatically managed All the internal traffic became encrypted and trusted ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/kudelski/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"nagra--kudelski-group-devops-engineer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nagra.com/\"\u003eNagra — Kudelski Group\u003c/a\u003e: DevOps Engineer\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-of-projects-and-tasks\"\u003eExample of Projects and Tasks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ai-integration\"\u003eAI integration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise of AI, I was tasked with evaluating the complexity and benefits of its implementation.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover.\nDigicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI also realized that most requests using Digicert actually didn\u0026rsquo;t need it and could as well use Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt for free and automated the process with ACME protocol.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI:\nThere was no documentation We had no track of who asked for what, when and why. The configuration were wrong, for example: nobody was receiving any notification some operations were wrongly blocked by the WAF (because the mail template were using ${variable} in templates, which looked like shell-injections) we needed to manually extract the OID value and search on the ActiveDirectory to find the requester\u0026rsquo;s email All the processes were done manually I fixed all the configuration issues and documented all processes.\nI added features like ACME to allow automatic management of the certificates.\nThis way:\nIt was easier for user to ask for certificates Validation was delegated to the internal DNS Renewal was automatically managed All the internal traffic became encrypted and trusted ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/kudelski/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"nagra--kudelski-group-devops-engineer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nagra.com/\"\u003eNagra — Kudelski Group\u003c/a\u003e: DevOps Engineer\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-of-projects-and-tasks\"\u003eExample of Projects and Tasks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ai-integration\"\u003eAI integration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise of AI, I was tasked with evaluating the complexity and benefits of its implementation.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover. Digicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI identified that many requests did not actually require Digicert and could use, for example, Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt instead.\nI enforced the use of the ACME protocol, presenting it to users as a self-provisioning, maintenance-free solution, and provided documentation and support to facilitate adoption.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI:\nThere was no documentation We had no track of who asked for what, when and why. The configuration were wrong, for example: nobody was receiving any notification some operations were wrongly blocked by the WAF (because the mail template were using ${variable} in templates, which looked like shell-injections) we needed to manually extract the OID value and search on the ActiveDirectory to find the requester\u0026rsquo;s email All the processes were done manually I fixed all the configuration issues and documented all processes.\nI added features like ACME to allow automatic management of the certificates.\nThis way:\nIt was easier for user to ask for certificates Validation was delegated to the internal DNS Renewal was automatically managed All the internal traffic became encrypted and trusted ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/kudelski/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"nagra--kudelski-group-devops-engineer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nagra.com/\"\u003eNagra — Kudelski Group\u003c/a\u003e: DevOps Engineer\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-of-projects-and-tasks\"\u003eExample of Projects and Tasks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ai-integration\"\u003eAI integration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise of AI, I was tasked with evaluating the complexity and benefits of its implementation.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover. Digicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI identified that many requests did not actually require Digicert and could use, for example, Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt instead.\nI enforced the use of the ACME protocol, presenting it to users as a self-provisioning, maintenance-free solution, and provided documentation and support to facilitate adoption.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI, there was no documentation, no tracking of requests, and many configuration issues:\nNotifications were not being sent.\nSome operations were blocked by the WAF due to mail templates using ${variable}, which resembled shell injections.\nOID values had to be manually extracted and matched in Active Directory to identify requesters.\nAll processes were performed manually.\nI resolved the configuration issues and documented all processes. I also added features such as ACME for automatic certificate management.\nAs a result:\nRequesting certificates became easier for users.\nValidation was delegated to the internal DNS.\nCertificate renewal was fully automated.\nAll internal traffic became encrypted and trusted.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/kudelski/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"nagra--kudelski-group-devops-engineer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.nagra.com/\"\u003eNagra — Kudelski Group\u003c/a\u003e: DevOps Engineer\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI joined the corporate IT team as the DevOps expert, simplifying and improving legacy services and adding new ones following state-of-the-art practices.\u003cbr\u003e\nMy management skills led me to take on projects beyond my role.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-of-projects-and-tasks\"\u003eExample of Projects and Tasks\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"ai-integration\"\u003eAI integration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the rise of AI, I was tasked with evaluating the complexity and benefits of its implementation.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover. Digicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI identified that many requests did not actually require Digicert and could use, for example, Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt instead.\nI enforced the use of the ACME protocol, presenting it to users as a self-provisioning, maintenance-free solution, and provided documentation and support to facilitate adoption.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI, there was no documentation, no tracking of requests, and many configuration issues:\nNotifications were not being sent. Some operations were blocked by the WAF due to mail templates using ${variable}, which resembled shell injections. OID values had to be manually extracted and matched in Active Directory to identify requesters. All processes were performed manually. I resolved the configuration issues and documented all processes. I also added features such as ACME for automatic certificate management.\nAs a result:\nRequesting certificates became easier for users. Validation was delegated to the internal DNS. Certificate renewal was fully automated. All internal traffic became encrypted and trusted.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover. Digicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI identified that many requests did not actually require Digicert and could use, for example, Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt instead.\nI enforced the use of the ACME protocol, presenting it to users as a self-provisioning, maintenance-free solution, and provided documentation and support to facilitate adoption.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI, there was no documentation, no tracking of requests, and many configuration issues:\nNotifications were not being sent. Some operations were blocked by the WAF due to mail templates using ${variable}, which resembled shell injections. OID values had to be manually extracted and matched in Active Directory to identify requesters. All processes were performed manually. I resolved the configuration issues and documented all processes. I also activated features such as ACME for automatic certificate management.\nAs a result:\nRequesting certificates became easier for users. Validation was delegated to the internal DNS. Certificate renewal was fully automated. All internal traffic became encrypted and trusted.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Cloudflare I was in charge of our Cloudflare accounts. I developed good reflexes regarding the Security aspects:\nWAF SSL \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams. Denodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover. Digicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI identified that many requests did not actually require Digicert and could use, for example, Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt instead.\nI enforced the use of the ACME protocol, presenting it to users as a self-provisioning, maintenance-free solution, and provided documentation and support to facilitate adoption.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI, there was no documentation, no tracking of requests, and many configuration issues:\nNotifications were not being sent. Some operations were blocked by the WAF due to mail templates using ${variable}, which resembled shell injections. OID values had to be manually extracted and matched in Active Directory to identify requesters. All processes were performed manually. I resolved the configuration issues and documented all processes. I also activated features such as ACME for automatic certificate management.\nAs a result:\nRequesting certificates became easier for users. Validation was delegated to the internal DNS. Certificate renewal was fully automated. All internal traffic became encrypted and trusted.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"},{"content":"Who am I ?

By improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\nBeing initially a developer and working on system administration, I naturally began developing the practices that I would later recognize as DevOps.\nCybersecurity Engineer I have a degree in cybersecurity from the School of Engineering and Management (HEIG-VD) and apply this knowledge daily in both development and system administration, especially in the context of the web. This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Netbox Inventory Cloudflare \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams.\nDenodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover. Digicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI identified that many requests did not actually require Digicert and could use, for example, Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt instead.\nI enforced the use of the ACME protocol, presenting it to users as a self-provisioning, maintenance-free solution, and provided documentation and support to facilitate adoption.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI, there was no documentation, no tracking of requests, and many configuration issues:\nNotifications were not being sent. Some operations were blocked by the WAF due to mail templates using ${variable}, which resembled shell injections. OID values had to be manually extracted and matched in Active Directory to identify requesters. All processes were performed manually. I resolved the configuration issues and documented all processes. I also activated features such as ACME for automatic certificate management.\nAs a result:\nRequesting certificates became easier for users. Validation was delegated to the internal DNS. Certificate renewal was fully automated. All internal traffic became encrypted and trusted.

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sàrl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net Sàrl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"}]
