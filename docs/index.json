I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

The skills I got and trained are:\nSecurity risks awareness: What is dangerous and why Security mitigation: How to prevent/fix such risks Software/Malware/Cryptographic Analysis. Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools\u0026hellip; Attacks On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers) On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, \u0026hellip;). Tools: wireshark, scapy, nmap, \u0026hellip; High/Low level programming attacks (e.g. various kind of injections like SQL injection or XSS/CSRF, buffer overflows, weak OAuth flows, \u0026hellip;) Side channel and fault attacks Various attacks using Metasploit and python scripting Defenses High/Low level programming (Good practices and algorithms, input sanitization, \u0026hellip;) Network: firewall, WAF, Snort Cryptography: Symetric and Asymetric Signatures(Simple, multi-sig and threshold)/Encryption(operating modes, authenticated cipher)/hash(cryptographically safe vs unsafe), SSL/TLS, \u0026hellip; A complete audit of a company was also part of the formation.\nIt is worth mentioning that, even though the knowledge required are linked, we did more attacks than defenses.\nNb: We did learn a lot, but these skills need to be sharpened with the experience.\nSoftware Engineer Good logic and understanding of various DSA and IT concepts Knowledge of many design patterns and paradigms. I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3.

I would need a few days to get back on track. Italian: ~A2 Portuguese: Notions (A1 at most, able to understand easy speeches) Japanese: Notions (N5 at most, still learning) Cybersecurity Engineer My CS Bachelor degree is about security. The skills I got and trained are:\nSecurity risks awareness: What is dangerous and why Security mitigation: How to prevent/fix such risks Software/Malware/Cryptographic Analysis. Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools\u0026hellip; Attacks On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers) On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, \u0026hellip;). Tools: wireshark, scapy, nmap, \u0026hellip; High/Low level programming attacks (e.g. various kind of injections like SQL injection or XSS/CSRF, buffer overflows, weak OAuth flows, \u0026hellip;) Side channel and fault attacks Various attacks using Metasploit and python scripting Defenses High/Low level programming (Good practices and algorithms, input sanitization, \u0026hellip;) Network: firewall, WAF, Snort Cryptography: Symetric and Asymetric Signatures(Simple, multi-sig and threshold)/Encryption(operating modes, authenticated cipher)/hash(cryptographically safe vs unsafe), SSL/TLS, \u0026hellip; A complete audit of a company was also part of the formation.\nIt is worth mentioning that, even though the knowledge required are linked, we did more attacks than defenses.\nNb: We did learn a lot, but these skills need to be sharpened with the experience.\nSoftware Engineer Good logic and understanding of various DSA and IT concepts Knowledge of many design patterns and paradigms. I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8.

But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

The skills I got and trained are:\nSecurity risks awareness: What is dangerous and why Security mitigation: How to prevent/fix such risks Software/Malware/Cryptographic Analysis. Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools\u0026hellip; Attacks On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers) On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, \u0026hellip;). Tools: wireshark, scapy, nmap, \u0026hellip; High/Low level programming attacks (e.g. various kind of injections like SQL injection or XSS/CSRF, buffer overflows, weak OAuth flows, \u0026hellip;) Side channel and fault attacks Various attacks using Metasploit and python scripting Defenses High/Low level programming (Good practices and algorithms, input sanitization, \u0026hellip;) Network: firewall, WAF, Snort Cryptography: Symetric and Asymetric Signatures(Simple, multi-sig and threshold)/Encryption(operating modes, authenticated cipher)/hash(cryptographically safe vs unsafe), SSL/TLS, \u0026hellip; A complete audit of a company was also part of the formation.\nIt is worth mentioning that, even though the knowledge required are linked, we did more attacks than defenses.\nNb: We did learn a lot, but these skills need to be sharpened with the experience.\nSoftware Engineer Good logic and understanding of various DSA and IT concepts Knowledge of many design patterns and paradigms. I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

The skills I got and trained are:\nSecurity risks awareness: What is dangerous and why Security mitigation: How to prevent/fix such risks Software/Malware/Cryptographic Analysis. Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools\u0026hellip; Attacks On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers) On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, \u0026hellip;). Tools: wireshark, scapy, nmap, \u0026hellip; High/Low level programming attacks (e.g. various kind of injections like SQL injection or XSS/CSRF, buffer overflows, weak OAuth flows, \u0026hellip;) Side channel and fault attacks Various attacks using Metasploit and python scripting Defenses High/Low level programming (Good practices and algorithms, input sanitization, \u0026hellip;) Network: firewall, WAF, Snort Cryptography: Symetric and Asymetric Signatures(Simple, multi-sig and threshold)/Encryption(operating modes, authenticated cipher)/hash(cryptographically safe vs unsafe), SSL/TLS, \u0026hellip; A complete audit of a company was also part of the formation.\nIt is worth mentioning that, even though the knowledge required are linked, we did more attacks than defenses.\nNb: We did learn a lot, but these skills need to be sharpened with the experience.\nSoftware Engineer Good logic and understanding of various DSA and IT concepts Knowledge of many design patterns and paradigms. I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

The skills I got and trained are:\nSecurity risks awareness: What is dangerous and why Security mitigation: How to prevent/fix such risks Software/Malware/Cryptographic Analysis. Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools\u0026hellip; Attacks On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers) On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, \u0026hellip;). Tools: wireshark, scapy, nmap, \u0026hellip; High/Low level programming attacks (e.g. various kind of injections like SQL injection or XSS/CSRF, buffer overflows, weak OAuth flows, \u0026hellip;) Side channel and fault attacks Various attacks using Metasploit and python scripting Defenses High/Low level programming (Good practices and algorithms, input sanitization, \u0026hellip;) Network: firewall, WAF, Snort Cryptography: Symetric and Asymetric Signatures(Simple, multi-sig and threshold)/Encryption(operating modes, authenticated cipher)/hash(cryptographically safe vs unsafe), SSL/TLS, \u0026hellip; A complete audit of a company was also part of the formation.\nIt is worth mentioning that, even though the knowledge required are linked, we did more attacks than defenses.\nNb: We did learn a lot, but these skills need to be sharpened with the experience.\nSoftware Engineer Good logic and understanding of various DSA and IT concepts Knowledge of many design patterns and paradigms. I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools\u0026hellip; Attacks On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers) On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, \u0026hellip;).

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

The skills I got and trained are:\nSecurity risks awareness: What is dangerous and why Security mitigation: How to prevent/fix such risks Software/Malware/Cryptographic Analysis. Tools: Ghidra, Volatility, gdb, pwntools\u0026hellip; Attacks On algorithm weakness (e.g. mode of operation for ciphers) On wireless network (e.g. sniffing, trame injections, \u0026hellip;).

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

I developed a custom extension to add many tools include some necessary for INET operations.\nI also tested the performances impact to optimize our joins. Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements. ServiceNow We used ServiceNow to expose our services in the Catalog.\nThis way, the rest of the company could easily ask us for standardized tasks.\nMy contributions Create and fix existing Catalog Items Added external automations that would pull from ServiceNow and/or push data to it.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.

We could for example combine data from our IPAM inventory and results of internal scans.\nMy contributions Create, fix and simplified different views.\nUsing less obvious tools like xpath, I simplified most of our views. I developed a custom extension to add many tools include some necessary for INET operations.\nI also tested the performances impact to optimize our joins. Typically, customs functions should not be used in JOIN statements.

I can easily compare many solutions. Easily adapt to the language idiomatic ways of programming which makes better code (performance, readability and maintenance) Ability to forecast and plan the implementation. The following chart shows my own programming language skill evaluation.\nSome more details below\n1. Python ðŸ—² Started to learn in 2018 and used daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; I am trying to get better statistical skills and learn to create my own ML models (pytorch)\n2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Used regularly at school and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 3. Rust â™¥ Started to learn at the beginning of 2022 by myself and got a course later on it during in my formation\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Interface (Swing) Web (Springboot) 6. Go Started to learn in 2019 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Started to learn in 2018 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\nSystem administrator (Linux) Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter Cryptography (Signatures, Challenges, encryptions, \u0026hellip;) I have a good understanding of cryptographical concepts.\nAmong them, I have worked a lot with certificates (public and internal).\nI know how self-signed certificates work and how to use them.\nWildcard certificates don\u0026rsquo;t work on the firs level, e.g. *.mydomain will not be validated by a browser for security reasons. But *.sub.mydomain will work.\nDNS CNAME are not aliases, they must be unique per name. This is why we cannot have a CNAME at the APEX: Because they conflict with the NS records. DNS are used for DNS-challenges upon certificate generation, especially when using multiple SAN or wildcard certificates.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"skills\"\u003eSkills\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"languages\"\u003eLanguages\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrench\u003c/strong\u003e: Mother tongue\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnglish\u003c/strong\u003e: B2 Cambridge certified (~C1 estimated, not certified)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerman\u003c/strong\u003e: B1 certified (~B2 estimated, not certified).

Odoo is a new generation ERP, aka \u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;. It positions itself as a contestant of the famous SAP, leader in this field.\nYou will find my opinion on Odoo here\nOpen Source Odoo community edition is Open Source, this means anyone can read the code here. Nb: The code for the enterprise edition is also open source, but you need to have an enterprise license to gain access.\nWhy is that important?\nOdoo Community is also a free software, meaning anyone can install and use this version. You can benefit from the OCA (\u0026ldquo;Odoo Community Association\u0026rdquo;) which develops many extensions to the framework. Open Source vs Security From a security perspective, security researcher tend to disagree whether it is a good or bad practice to have Open Source code. Hiding the code is called \u0026ldquo;blackbox security\u0026rdquo;, you make it more difficult for hackers to find an exploit. I personally disagree:\nThere are powerful tools that a malicious person can use to find exploits Even without reading the code, there are ways to find exploits. Once an exploit is found by a malicious person, it can take months before it is discovered and fixed. Only ethical hackers/security research won\u0026rsquo;t be able to help without obtaining special permissions. Having the code Open Source make it easier for everyone to read and contribute. You are more likely to have helpful feedback than attacks. Prices Odoo community is totally free, but free can be expensive: having someone to maintain and migrate your Odoo, losing your data because of a mistake, having bad processes/configuration of your Odoo because you never got a formation on the tool, \u0026hellip; all of this cost money.\nIf you want to use Odoo community, I still recommend having a formation made by an official integrator. Odoo enterprise requires a paid license, but: The price is quite affordable You have support and migration from Odoo SA You benefit from more modules maintained by Odoo (which is, from my point of view, the least interesting privilege) End-Users usage I honestly think that, for end-users, Odoo is a great tool:\nIt is modular, you can activate any module just with one single click.\nTherefore, you won\u0026rsquo;t be as cluttered as other solutions Functional fields are quite well integrated and will suit most of your needs out of the box. There are many tutorials, documentations and forums to help you Odoo can be customized easily, it even provides its own tool called \u0026ldquo;Odoo Studio\u0026rdquo; which allows you to customize your ERP. Odoo Studio: Not recommended (personal opinion) I personally discourage the use of this tool, at least for the moment:\nYou can never just \u0026ldquo;remove\u0026rdquo; something you made, it will hide it, which has a big performance downside\nYou can break your Odoo: this has been improved a lot, but this is still possible to break something. We had a client that required 7 min to open a mere page because of an error he did with this tool.\nDepending on the change you make, some module won\u0026rsquo;t be able to be installed anymore.\nIf once you need to have some more complex modifications requiring a developer to make it, it will make the development a lot harder and certainly increase the total cost of the development.\nDevelopment It is the easiest framework I have ever used, even more than Ruby-on-rails, we can easily create new models/fields/view/custom search filters/reports/\u0026hellip;. in minutes! What\u0026rsquo;s hard is knowing the whole Odoo ecosystems and functional needs. The framework is not the fastest (if compared with Django, FastAPI or ROR) but it is fast enough and is becoming faster through the versions. The security layer is also integrated into the framework. This prevents from mistakes that would cause security issues and spares a lot of time.\nThey are also making their source code more \u0026ldquo;hookable\u0026rdquo; which simplifies how the software can be extended.\nMy modules I have developed and publish some modules through time, but most of them are not maintained.\nodoo_graphql: Add a generic graphql API to Odoo. Graphql is a good to retrieve data, this module can be useful when an external system needs to retrieve data from Odoo.

They dropped 2nd in Switzerland and 22nd worldwide 2 years after my departure. Roles, responsibilities and attributions Through hard and consistant work, I quickly gained a lot of roles in this company.\nLead Sysadmin: Stabilize, document, standardize and improve the infrastructure. Lead Developer: Evaluate and assign projects, Take over sensitive tasks, code reviews, candidate interview, new hired and apprentices onboarding. Security Expert: Project Manager: Business Analyst (for some of our biggest customers) Logistic ERP Expert (Stock, Manufacturing, Repair, PLM, \u0026hellip; ) With all these roles to manage in parallel, I got better at scheduling my priorities and taking decisions.\nThe story in details 1. How I became SysAdmin When I arrived in the company:\nthere was almost a crash per week. There was no troubleshooting methodology, nor post mortems. Anybody, regardless of their experience, would be assigned the task of fixing the issue.\nThis often resulted in a reboot of the customer instance which solved the issue only temporarily. There was no documentation nor procedure on how to deploy the the services, therefore all the instances were heterogenous. There was no monitoring, the management of the certificates was done manually. I requested to be assigned to the troubleshooting whenever something happened and kept notes of the issues detected.\nThis allowed to better identify the cause of the issues and quickly fix them.\nIn a second time, I worked with a colleague on defining a proper infrastructure and installation procedure. This included:\nUsing Ansible for the configuration of customer instances GitOps deployment of the new features Simplified IaC to manage the reverse proxy and certificate generation (Certbot + LetsEncrypt) Monitoring using Zabbix Fixed and limited accesses the instances Integrated a WAF on our infrastructure. \u0026hellip; When the colleague I was working with left the company, I onboarded 2 other colleagues on the administration side to ensure the well continuity of the project.\nThe last improvement was to move our infrastructure to the Cloud: The infrascture we had could not scale neither up (for new customers) nor down (if customers where to leave). Managing the hardware had a cost and accessing the datacenter would take at least 2 hours in case of an issue.\nI tested multiple solutions: AWS (EC2, Kubernetes), GCP, OVH (with Saas Proxmox to extend our cluster), Jelastic (with different structures), \u0026hellip;\nThe main issue was generally the price. We also didn\u0026rsquo;t have a need for complex tools like kubernetes.\nAfter many researches and comparison, I was able to find a Cloud that was even cheaper on average than what we were paying for our on-prem infrastructure.\nI defined a smooth migration plan for our 150 customers over 6 months. If we passed the 6 months deadline, we would be commited for another year of lease in the datacenter which would have costed a lot of money. Most of the procedure was automated using terraform and cloud-init scripts.\nAll customers migration dates were scheduled and spaced them for safety.\nAs we knew that I was leaving in a few months and couldn\u0026rsquo;t do the migration myself, but also for the sake of properly transferring the knowledge, I did the first few migration in front of my colleagues, then assigned the task to one of them and supervised him during his first few migrations.\nA few month after my departure, I got the confirmation from my colleague that everything went smoothly and on time takes to the detailed procedure and planification made.\n2. Project Manager \u0026amp; Business Analyst When I arrived, I started to work on the customer that would soon become our biggest customer. This customer had big needs on the logistic side, and I quickly realized that nobody was confortable with this topic in the company. I started to learn and practice on my side to better understand how the logistic work in Odoo and learned how different companies works (Make-to-stock, Make-to-order, FIFO vs LIFO, storable vs consumable, tracking, \u0026hellip;). Working on this customer helped me train my newly acquired knowledges.\nThis customer had people from different departments (Stock, Manufacturing, Marketing, Sales, Accounting, \u0026hellip;) and I would do a meeting once a week with them in an Agile manner to define the next steps of the project. Thanks to this, I developed the capacity to understand and conciliate the needs of multiple different people that, sometimes, don\u0026rsquo;t want to make compromises.\nHonestly, this was a huge risk to assign a customer to a new hired so fast. The same expirement happened with other new hired, this would sometimes work, but we lost many customer because of this.\nI got assigned many other customers, either new customers with specific logistic needs, or existing customers unhappy with their current point of contact. Many of these unhappy customers were about to leave the company but I was able to re-assure them and provide them with a good support.\nI never lost a customer.\n3. Lead Developer Role: This happened by itself. As time passed, my colleagues would face some issue and ask others for help. The more I fixed their issues, the more I gained their trust. I had set up a bookstack instance and documented there things that they asked me. I was also completing more tickets and more complexe ones on top of that. I was also the only one that was doing a bachelor at this moment. I got assigned tasks like:\nCode review Project complexity evaluation Review of candidate resume (and their projects on github) Technical Interviews of the candiates Onboarding of new hired and apprentices Optimization of code (with a few tweaks, I made a script run from 3h to 15min) All of that combined made me gain the title of lead developer very soon.\nSecurity Engineer As I was doing my roles of Sysadmin and Lead Developer, I sometimes discovered insecure code / configuration and fixed them.\nI was also doing a bachelor in Cybersecurity in parallel of my job.\nThere was no clearly defined responsabilities. I was already reviewing the infrastructure and code with security in mind.\nThis title was mostly useful to reassure the customers. Typically, some customers would just run a scanning tool like Tenable Nessus and would panic when they see a medium CVSS score that they don\u0026rsquo;t understand.\nFor example, at some point we were using NGINX 1.18 when the 1.21 was out for compatibility reason with modeSecurity V3. The CVSS score reported 2 things:\noff-by-one on the resolver: requires that we use the resolver feature, which we were not using. It also required specific conditions for the exploit. module to optimize the streaming video: We didn\u0026rsquo;t even have the module installed. These customers sometimes paid external parties that didn\u0026rsquo;t provide any explanation and were not granted any permission to scan our infrastructure.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/carrer/open-net/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"open-net-sÃ rl\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.open-net.ch/\"\u003eOpen Net SÃ rl\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWorked on \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/\"\u003eOdoo\u003c/a\u003e ERP (\u0026ldquo;Enterprise resource planning\u0026rdquo;), a contestant of the famous \u003ca href=\"https://www.sap.com\"\u003eSAP\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom September 2018 to September 2023\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOdoo gold partner (when I worked there): \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners/country/suisse-41\"\u003e1st partner in Switzerland\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.odoo.com/fr_FR/partners?\u0026amp;country_all=True\"\u003e7th partner worldwide\u003c/a\u003e.
