This added depth to the way I conduct code reviews and audits.\nI also have a solid understanding of cryptography concepts, especially digital signatures and encryption, which are essential for security. I follow developments in post-quantum cryptography to anticipate future challenges. My bachelor thesis focused on threshold signatures on embedded systems, which are related to blockchain.\nThis naturally led me from DevOps to DevSecOps, integrating static analysis tools and implementing security policies.\nProject Manager Project management is often overlooked, and its value underestimated. Many managers are skilled engineers who have never fully made the switch and struggle to plan effectively for others in the long term. It is also common for management to become a blackbox, isolated from the team, which can lead to long meetings, micromanagement, and, most importantly, dissatisfaction.\nHaving experienced these frustrations firsthand, I took charge of projects and gradually learned how to manage them effectively. I take responsibility for planning and guiding projects while recognizing that I cannot know everything: listening to team members, accepting constructive criticism, and delegating tasks are essential to effective management.\nIn addition, I worked directly with customers while leading development projects, particularly in the context of Odoo ERP. This experience taught me how to define precise, feasible project specifications even from unclear requests, ensuring they meet customer needs. I also learned how to communicate and document effectively, and how to respond calmly and efficiently in emergency situations.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/skills/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"lead-software-engineer\"\u003eLead Software Engineer\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than chasing complexity, I keep solutions simple, efficient, and maintainable, which allows projects to move forward smoothly.\nThis pragmatism, combined with my strong technical skills, enabled me to advance quickly to the position of Lead Software Developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also take care to help and mentor my teammates in this same approach, ensuring they feel valued and respected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/programming-languages/\"\u003eMore information about the programming languages I use\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"system-administrator-linux\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/cv/skills/sysadmin/\"\u003eSystem Administrator (Linux)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeyond development, I took responsibility for the administration systems, identifying and resolving many long-standing issues.\nBy improving system stability and streamlining workflows, I ensured a more reliable infrastructure and drastically reduced the number of failures.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Skills"},{"content":"Certificats This page contains the list of all my certificates.\nCloud \u0026amp; Sysadmin These certificates come from the Cloud Engineer IT Professional Program bootcamp on The Linux Foundation Platform.

I worked primarily with CrewAI, Ollama, and Python on LLMs.\nWhile LLMs are easy to extend and integrate, common use cases, such as corporate-specific responses, are already addressed by existing products.\nImplementing AI internally without creating a new product would have introduced unnecessary technical debt.\nDomain Names Inventory We owned hundreds of domain names with no consolidated tracking. Previous attempts at inventory were outdated and scattered across multiple registrar platforms.\nI assessed the situation and led a corporate-wide collection of information over several months to consolidate the inventory. I ensured that each domain had a clear owner and implemented notifications for ownership transfer when an owner departs.\nThe inventory now enables security scans and monitoring, ensures a known point of contact for faster issue resolution, allows periodic review to remove unused domains, and serves as a reliable source for automations.\nIt has also been extended to manage parked domains, ensuring proper records, hardening, and HTTP redirections, reducing workload for the CorpSec, Legal, and Marketing teams.\nMonitoring: Grafana-Prometheus Stack Netbox Inventory Cloudflare \u0026hellip; Our team also acted as a broker between Cloudflare and other teams.\nDenodo (Data Agregation Platform) Created, fixed, and simplified various views, using techniques like xpath to streamline complex queries. Developed a custom extension adding multiple tools, including ones essential for INET operations. Tested performance impacts to optimize joins, avoiding costly use of custom functions in JOIN statements. ServiceNow Defined and refined existing catalog items. Used ServiceNow as the source of truth for automations. Developed Flow Tools, including Actions Integrated ServiceNow with the Power Automate platform. Acted as a user and fulfiller of the platform, ensuring end-to-end understanding of workflows. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) Digicert: External PKI When I took over Digicert management, the process was largely manual, with no tracking or history, as all previous requests had been submitted via email.\nRequesters had to monitor certificate expirations themselves, which led to major outages when multiple certificates expired between my predecessor\u0026rsquo;s departure and my takeover. Digicert certificates are expensive, and my predecessor used a laborious workaround with wildcard and duplicate certificates to save costs, which further complicated management.\nI identified that many requests did not actually require Digicert and could use, for example, Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt instead.\nI enforced the use of the ACME protocol, presenting it to users as a self-provisioning, maintenance-free solution, and provided documentation and support to facilitate adoption.\nEJBCA: Internal PKI When I took over the PKI, there was no documentation, no tracking of requests, and many configuration issues:\nNotifications were not being sent. Some operations were blocked by the WAF due to mail templates using ${variable}, which resembled shell injections. OID values had to be manually extracted and matched in Active Directory to identify requesters. All processes were performed manually. I resolved the configuration issues and documented all processes. I also activated features such as ACME for automatic certificate management.\nAs a result:\nRequesting certificates became easier for users. Validation was delegated to the internal DNS. Certificate renewal was fully automated. All internal traffic became encrypted and trusted.

Python 🗲 Since 2018 Used daily Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Web: Fastapi, Flask, Django, Odoo ORM: SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm, Odoo ML/AI: CrewAI and Ollama (Existing LLM consumption), PyTorch (Model fine-tuning) Data: Pandas, numpy Interface: Tkinter, pygame Scripting/Scrapping: lxml, json, requests/httpx, Pillow (image processing), BeautifulSoup, \u0026hellip; \u0026hellip; 2. C/C++ Since 2016 Used regularly in the past and occasionally on small personal projects Implementation of custom-made Data structures and algorithms at need for performance. Now, I usually prefer to use Rust when possible Frameworks \u0026amp; libraries: Interface/Graphism: SFML, QT (Did a harmonic movement simulator) Web: CrowCpp, Pistache.io Math: Eigen Misc: Boost, nlohmann/json, \u0026hellip; 3. Rust ♥ Since 2022\nMy current favorite language.\nIts syntax, its powerful macros, its project management and its good design and good usage of functional programming concepts, security concerns \u0026hellip; are unmatched\nFrameworks \u0026amp; libraries:\nWeb: Rocket, Axum \u0026amp; Actix Concurrency: Rayon, Tokyo Serialization: Serde (what else ?) ORM: Diesel Permissions: Casbin CLI: clap and the list keeps growing!\n4. Javascript (\u0026amp; Web) Started to learn in 2018 Mostly frontends: Vuejs, ReactJS, AlpineJs, HTMX, Jquery, OWL, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap.\nNb: I don\u0026rsquo;t have a graphical skill, meaning I am usually not the one creating the design. Also did some projects on: algorithms implementations, rendering, scrapping (puppeteer), ML (Tensorflow for hand gesture recognition) and WebRTC/streaming 5. Java Since 2019 Mostly did: Data structure and algorithms implementations Web (Springboot) Interface (Swing) 6. Go Since 2020 Mostly did: Microservices (e.g. proxy to transform requests) Terraform provider 7. Bash Since 2016 Mostly did: I extensively use the terminal. Using bash allow me to test and reproduce my workflows. One-shot scripts CI scripts (often in combination with Makefile and Phony targets) 8. SQL I am comfortable with the old standard and the Postgres\u0026rsquo; flavor, but since I saw modern SQL, I think I have some more to learn before being statisfied with my level.\n9. Kotlin Learned the basics of how to create a native android app.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/programming-languages/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"timeline\"\u003eTimeline\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cpre class=\"mermaid\"\u003e\n  timeline\n    2016 : C++\n         : Bash\n    2018 : Python\n         : Javascript\n    2019 : Java\n    2020 : Go\n    2022 : Rust\n\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"mastery\"\u003eMastery\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \u003ccanvas id='01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12' width='' height=''\u003e\u003c/canvas\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n        (function () {\n            var ctx = document.getElementById('01ecea100b41d6d6ca1902247fcc0e12');\n            var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {\n                type: \"bar\",\n                data: {\n                    labels: [\"Python\",\"Rust\",\"Go\",\"Javascript\",\"C/C++\",\"Bash\",\"SQL\",\"Java\"],\n                    datasets: [{\n                        label: null,\n                        data: [100,65,80,70,80,50,70,70],\n                        backgroundColor: [\"#FF638433\",\"#36A2EB33\",\"#FFCE5633\",\"#4BC0C033\",\"#9966FF33\",\"#FF9F4033\",\"#8FBC8F33\",\"#00FFFF33\",\"#A52A2A33\",\"#FF00FF33\",\"#87CEFA33\"],\n                        borderColor: [\"#FF6384FF\",\"#36A2EBFF\",\"#FFCE56FF\",\"#4BC0C0FF\",\"#9966FFFF\",\"#FF9F40FF\",\"#8FBC8FFF\",\"#00FFFFFF\",\"#A52A2AFF\",\"#FF00FFFF\",\"#87CEFAFF\"],\n                        borderWidth: 1\n                    }],\n                },\n                options: {\n                    plugins: {\n                        legend: { display: false }\n                    },\n                    scales: {\n                        yAxes: [{\n                            ticks: {\n                                beginAtZero: true,\n                            }\n                        }]\n                    }\n                }  \n            });\n        })();\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSome more details below\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Programming Languages"},{"content":" Reverse Proxy: Nginx, Traefik Containers/virtualization: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic Management: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant Network: iptables, nftables, snort Monitoring: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd Benchmark: Apache Jmeter ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/cv/skills/sysadmin/","summary":"\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReverse Proxy\u003c/strong\u003e: Nginx, Traefik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainers/virtualization\u003c/strong\u003e: Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, OpenStack, Jelastic\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManagement\u003c/strong\u003e: Ansible, Fabrik, Terraform (+ Terragrunt), Vagrant\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNetwork\u003c/strong\u003e: iptables, nftables, snort\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonitoring\u003c/strong\u003e: Zabbix, Grafana Dashboard, fluentd\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenchmark\u003c/strong\u003e: Apache Jmeter\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e","title":"SysAdmin (linux)"}]
