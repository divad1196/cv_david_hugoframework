Python Started to learn in 2018 Use daily: work (Odoo) and hobbies Web Scrapping Scripting Micro web services Master python3.5 / python3.6 Know features up to python3.10, but can\u0026rsquo;t be used at work e.g. match pattern, Framework \u0026amp; librairies This is a summary of the most pertinent/useful ones I have worked with.\nFastapi Flask Django SQLAlchemy, PonyOrm lxml, json, requests, Pillow, \u0026hellip; (Web Scrapping) Pandas, numpy (Data management) Tkinter, pygame (prepare playful exercises) 2. C/C++ Started to learn in 2016 Use regulary at school, occasionaly otherwise Small project: Implementation of Data structures and algorithms (to learn and/or compute large amount of values) Framework \u0026amp; librairies SFML QT CrowCpp, Pistache.io Boost Eigen 3. Javascript Framework \u0026amp; librairies 1. Vuejs 2. Reactjs 3. Jquery 4. SQL (Postgesql) 5. Java 6. Bash System administrator (Linux) Security Engineer My CS Bachelor degree is about security.
